Personal Hobbies

I have many hobbies but the most notable would be surfing. I learned how to surf
when I was about 6 years old. My dad always wanted me to learn because him and 
his brothers would always surf together when they were my age. I have always enjoyed
surfing my whole life and I try to go as often as possible. I like to surf with 
friends right before the sun goes down because thats when I think it's the most
memorable and beautiful.
