<h1>Family Page</h1>
  
<p>I have a rather large family with 6 of us in total. My mom, dad, and three other brothers. My dad works as a Contractor and helps build homes in the poorer parts of mexico. My mom is a Marketing VP for my dad's company. My oldest brother, Robert, is currently in Afghanistan working as a computer programmer. My second oldest brother, Curren, is currently attending his second year at UCSB, where I plan to go when I graduate. My youngest brother, Stephen, is attending Canyon Crest Academy as a sophomore.
